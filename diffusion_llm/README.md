## Datasets
You can access the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NF7VEefXCmXuWNbnNe858WvQAkJ_7wuP/view?usp=sharing), then place the downloaded contents under `./dataset`

## Quick Demos
1. Download datasets and place them under `./dataset`
2. Tune the model and the script according to the description in the paper if needed. We provide five experiment scripts for demonstration purpose under the folder `./scripts`. For example, you can evaluate on ETT datasets by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTh1.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTh2.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTm1.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTm2.sh
```

## Detailed usage

Please refer to ```run_main.py``` for the detailed description of each hyperparameter.
