The Influenza-like Illness dataset contains weekly records of patients experiencing severe influenza symptoms with complications, collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. It spans from 2002 to 2021 and captures the ratio of outpatient visits for ILI symptoms to the total number of patient visits.
